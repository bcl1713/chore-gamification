# Project Definition Report: Household Chore Gamification System

## Project Description

The Household Chore Gamification System is a web-based application designed to
transform daily household tasks and habit formation into an engaging, game-like
experience. The system will incentivize and track the completion of household
chores and personal habits through gamification elements such as points,
achievements, and rewards.

### Key Features

- User management for household members
- Chore and habit tracking system
- Point/reward system
- Progress tracking and visualization
- Achievement system
- Mobile-responsive design for easy access on any device

### Target Users

- Families
- Household members
- Individuals looking to build better habits
- Parents wanting to encourage children's participation in household duties

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- React for component development
- TailwindCSS for styling
- ShadcnUI for component library
- State Management: Either React Context or Zustand (lightweight alternative to
  Redux)

### Backend

- Next.js API routes for backend functionality
- Prisma as ORM
- PostgreSQL for database
- Authentication: NextAuth.js
- Bcrypt for password hashing

### Infrastructure

- Docker for containerization
- Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Nginx as reverse proxy (if needed)
- Optional: Redis for caching

### Development Tools

- Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- TypeScript for type safety

- Production environment setup
- Deployment pipeline implementation

## Authentication Strategy

### Test-Driven Development Approach

The authentication system will be implemented following TDD principles:

1. Write failing tests for each feature
2. Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
4. Integrate with existing components

### Security Considerations

1. Password Security

   - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
   - Strong password requirements
   - Safe password reset process

2. Session Management

   - Secure session storage
   - Token rotation
   - Automatic session expiration
   - Concurrent session handling

3. OAuth Security

   - Secure provider integration
   - State parameter validation
   - Scope restrictions
   - Token security

4. Email Security
   - Secure token generation
   - Limited token lifetime
   - Email verification requirement
   - Anti-spam measures

### Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Authentication Monitoring

   - Failed login attempts
   - Account lockouts
   - Password reset requests
   - OAuth errors

2. Security Updates

   - Regular dependency updates
   - Security patch management
   - Vulnerability monitoring
   - Security advisory tracking

3. Performance Monitoring
   - Authentication response times
   - Session management metrics
   - Database query performance
   - OAuth provider status
