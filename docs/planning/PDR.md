# Project Definition Report: Household Chore Gamification System

## Project Description

The Household Chore Gamification System is a web-based application designed to
transform daily household tasks and habit formation into an engaging, game-like
experience. The system will incentivize and track the completion of household
chores and personal habits through gamification elements such as points,
achievements, and rewards.

### Key Features

- User management for household members
- Chore and habit tracking system
- Point/reward system
- Progress tracking and visualization
- Achievement system
- Mobile-responsive design for easy access on any device

### Target Users

- Families
- Household members
- Individuals looking to build better habits
- Parents wanting to encourage children's participation in household duties

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- React for component development
- TailwindCSS for styling
- ShadcnUI for component library
- State Management: Either React Context or Zustand (lightweight alternative to
  Redux)

### Backend

- Next.js API routes for backend functionality
- Prisma as ORM
- PostgreSQL for database
- Authentication: NextAuth.js

### Infrastructure

- Docker for containerization
- Docker Compose for service orchestration
- Nginx as reverse proxy (if needed)
- Optional: Redis for caching

### Development Tools

- Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
