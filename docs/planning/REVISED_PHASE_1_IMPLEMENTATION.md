# Revised Phase 1 Implementation Checklist

## Project Setup and Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)

### 1. Development Environment Setup

- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Configure Docker development environment
- [x] Set up local development tools (Neovim, ESLint, Prettier)
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [x] Verify development environment functionality

### 2. Minimal Test Infrastructure Setup

- [x] Install Jest and React Testing Library
- [x] Create basic test configuration
- [x] Set up minimal test utilities without auth dependencies
- [x] Configure basic CI pipeline for initial tests

### 3. Database Schema Design

- [x] Design initial schema with focus on user/auth tables
- [x] Create migration strategy
- [x] Implement Prisma schema
- [x] Create database seed framework
- [x] Write schema tests

### 4. Authentication Implementation (With TDD Approach)

#### 4.1 Authentication Planning

- [ ] Define authentication requirements
- [ ] Create authentication user stories
- [ ] Design authentication flow diagrams
- [ ] Document security requirements

#### 4.2 Core Authentication Tests

- [ ] Write test specifications for auth flows
- [ ] Create auth testing utilities
- [ ] Implement mock auth providers for testing

#### 4.3 Authentication Implementation

- [ ] Install and configure NextAuth.js
- [ ] Implement user model and authentication flows
- [ ] Set up protected route handling
- [ ] Create auth middleware
- [ ] Implement session management

#### 4.4 Authentication Integration

- [ ] Write integration tests for auth flows
- [ ] Create auth state management
- [ ] Implement auth hooks and utilities
- [ ] Set up auth error handling

### 5. Complete Test Infrastructure

- [ ] Expand test utilities with auth support
- [ ] Configure Cypress with auth handling
- [ ] Create authenticated test helpers
- [ ] Set up test data factories
- [ ] Implement common test scenarios

### 6. Initial User Stories Development

- [ ] Define core feature requirements
- [ ] Create user story templates
- [ ] Document acceptance criteria
- [ ] Create test specifications for user stories

### 7. CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement

- [ ] Expand GitHub Actions configuration
- [ ] Set up test automation with auth support
- [ ] Configure deployment workflows
- [ ] Create environment-specific configurations

## Progress Tracking

- Current Phase: 1
- Progress: 0/7 major tasks completed
- Total Steps: 0/35
- Current Focus: Development Environment Setup
- Expected Completion: Week 2

## Dependencies

- Docker Desktop
- Node.js 20+
- Neovim 0.9+
- Git
- PostgreSQL client
- Development tools (ripgrep, fd)

## Key Changes from Original Plan

1. Moved minimal test infrastructure setup earlier but kept it focused
2. Positioned database schema before authentication
3. Expanded authentication implementation with TDD approach
4. Added complete test infrastructure setup after auth
5. Maintained CI/CD as final step with enhanced auth awareness

## Review Points

- Development Environment Review
- Schema Design Review
- Authentication Architecture Review
- Test Coverage Review
- Security Review
- Documentation Review

## Notes

- Authentication implementation now follows TDD principles while allowing for
  proper test infrastructure setup
- Test utilities are implemented in two phases: basic setup and auth-aware
  expansion
- Schema design precedes authentication to ensure proper data model
- CI/CD pipeline is enhanced after auth implementation to ensure proper test
  coverage
