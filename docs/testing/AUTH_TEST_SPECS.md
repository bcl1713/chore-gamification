# Authentication Test Specifications - Core Backend

This document outlines the test specifications for core authentication
functionality, focusing on backend operations before UI implementation.

## User Authentication Tests

### User Creation

1. User Registration Operations

   - [x] Should enforce email uniqueness
   - [x] Should handle invalid email formats
   - [x] Should hash password correctly
   - [x] Should set correct default values (points, level)
   - [x] Should generate verification token
   - [x] Should enforce password requirements

2. OAuth Account Linking
   - [x] Should create new user from OAuth data
   - [ ] Should link OAuth account to existing user
   - [ ] Should prevent duplicate OAuth accounts
   - [ ] Should handle missing OAuth data gracefully

### Session Management

1. Session Operations

   - [ ] Should create new session with correct expiry
   - [ ] Should validate session tokens
   - [ ] Should handle session refresh
   - [ ] Should properly expire sessions
   - [ ] Should handle concurrent sessions
   - [ ] Should invalidate sessions on password change

2. Session Security
   - [ ] Should implement CSRF protection
   - [ ] Should handle token rotation
   - [ ] Should detect session tampering
   - [ ] Should manage cookie security attributes

### Email Verification

1. Verification Flow
   - [ ] Should generate secure verification tokens
   - [ ] Should validate token expiration
   - [ ] Should update user email verified status
   - [ ] Should handle invalid/expired tokens
   - [ ] Should prevent verification of already verified emails

### Password Reset

1. Reset Token Management

   - [ ] Should generate secure reset tokens
   - [ ] Should enforce token expiration
   - [ ] Should validate token uniqueness
   - [ ] Should handle concurrent reset requests

2. Password Update Operations
   - [ ] Should validate password requirements
   - [ ] Should update password hash
   - [ ] Should invalidate existing sessions
   - [ ] Should handle invalid reset attempts
   - [ ] Should prevent reuse of old tokens

## Testing Strategy

### Test Data Management

- Use isolated test database
- Implement test data factories
- Clean up test data after each test
- Mock external services (email)

### Mocking Strategy

1. External Services

   - Mock email service responses
   - Mock OAuth provider responses
   - Mock rate limiting service

2. Database Operations
   - Use test transactions
   - Reset database state between tests
   - Mock Prisma client for unit tests

### Test Environment

- Use `.env.test` configuration
- Configure test database
- Mock external services
- Set up auth utilities

## Implementation Order

1. User Operations

   - Basic user creation
   - Password hashing
   - Email validation
   - OAuth account linking

2. Session Management

   - Session creation
   - Token validation
   - Session refresh
   - Session invalidation

3. Verification & Reset

   - Email verification
   - Password reset
   - Token management

4. Security Features
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting
   - Token rotation

## Implementation Notes

1. Test Database

   - Use separate test database
   - Implement cleanup procedures
   - Create seed data utilities

2. Authentication Utilities

   - Password hashing helpers
   - Token generation utilities
   - Session management helpers

3. Mocking Utilities
   - OAuth provider mocks
   - Email service mocks
   - Database operation mocks
